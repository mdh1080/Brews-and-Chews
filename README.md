# Brews-and-Chews

## Description
We created a web application to find a brewery and restaurant within the same city. Breweries are a poplular destination when traveling and this allows the user to easily find a location based on the city they are in. Many breweries don't serve meals, so we added a restaurant locator to find restaurants within a short distance of the brewery. Two API's were used in creating this application. The brewery and restaurant are chosen randomly and are not based on the API's first result. 

## Usage
Enter city in the search box that you would like to find a brewery and restaurant for. If you would like more options for the brewery or restaurant, search the city again and it will show different results.
